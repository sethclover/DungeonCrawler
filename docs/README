### Assignment 1.10 README

For the final assignment, I focused on rounding out the mechanics of
the game, accounting for edges cases of previous features, and adding
new mechanics that make the game seem more complete. Its a long list
and the changelog from 9.1.0 to 10.0.0 explains it all in more detail.
I added colors for the player and status messages based on their
source. Defense, hit bonus, and dodge bonus is functional. Lights and
flasks work. Added random quips for building and cleaning the project. 
Actions during a turn are recorded and can be viewed with 'v'. Better
line of sight was added. There are also several additions that I have
made before the final assignment, including colored distance maps with
'D' and 'T', win and loss screen ASCII art, and a command list with
'?'.
