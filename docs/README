### Assignment 1.07 README

This assignment adds parsing to the project. I implemented parsing
for both objects and monsters. I used lex and yacc to parse the .txt
files and distribute them into a list of object or monster type lists,
which were defined in their own header file. There is a new switch
for printing the parsing, --parse-monsters and --parse-objects, which
will print the information parsed from the respective files to cout.
The switches will automatically fetch the monster_desc.txt and
object_desc.txt files from the .rlg327 folder in the home directory.
The Makefile was updated to include the lexer.l and parser.y files,
along with the parser.hpp header file. The changes are tracked, just
like any other .cpp and .hpp, so make will detect the changes.
