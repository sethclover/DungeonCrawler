### Assignment 1.06 README

I ported my dungeon crawler from C to C++, renaming .c files to .cpp
and updating the makefile to use the C++ compiler. Every struct
became a class. I added a "Fog of War" system, where the PCâ€™s light
(radius 3 from the PC), remembering seen terrain while unseen areas
render as rock. Monsters are visible only when lit, and unchanged
memory persists if they alter unseen terrain. The new debugging
commands include 'f' to toggle fog-free viewing and 'g' to enter
teleport mode, moving a '+' cursor with keys, then teleporting with
another 'g' or randomly with 'r'. The ncurses interface, controls
('7'/'y', '8'/'k', etc.), stairs ('>' and '<'), and monster list
('m') remain, ending with 'Q', death, or no monsters left unslain.
