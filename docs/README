### Assignment 1.09 README

For assignment 1.09, Combat was finally added in the form of health
and damage takes the place of dying when another character moves to
the space of another character. Items can be equipped to alter the
player's stats, including damage and speed. There are a bunch of new
switches such as 'w' for wearing an item from an inventory slot,
't' for taking something off from an equipment slot, 'i' and 'e' for
the inventory and equipment menus, respectively, 'x' for removing an
item from the dungeon permanently, 'd' for dropping an item from the
player's inventory to the group, and 'I' for inspecting the description
of an object. Monsters also will no longer kill each other with 
contact because they will instead push them to a different square.
Killing the boss is the win condition for the dungeon now.
