### Assignment 1.08 README

For this assignment, I added monsters and objects to the dungeon from
their corresponding parsed files (monster_desc.txt and object_desc.txt)
Each monster and object is an instance of its parsed type. Monsters
have fields for their name, description, colors, speed, abilities, hp,
damage, symbol, and rarity. In contrast, objects have the fields name,
description, type(s), symbol (derived from their type), colors, hit,
damage, dodge, defense, weight, speed, attributes, value, artifact
status, rarity. Characters show up on top of objects. Artifacts and
Boss/Unique monsters will not spawn again after they are picked up
or killed. If a monster/object has more than one color, each time it
is reprinted, it will cycle to the next color in its list.
