Gazing into the dungeon’s stillness, no tasks stir...
Resting by the campfire, the adventure pauses...
Listening to the crypt’s silence, all is calm...
The forge lies cold, its fire dreaming...
No scrolls to scribe, no paths to trace...
Silence reigns in the spellbound workshop...
The runes sleep, and the code waits in stillness...
All is still beneath the dungeon’s stone heart...
The enchanter's table lies bare, awaiting ingredients...
The ritual circle remains dormant, its power spent...
The arcane forge cools, with no metals to transform...
All constructs stand completed, awaiting commands...
The nexus of power rests, its energy reserves full...
The summoning altar remains clean, no entities due to arrive...
The dimensional anchors hold steady, all gateways sealed...
