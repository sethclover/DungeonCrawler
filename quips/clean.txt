Sweeping cobwebs from the crypt’s corners...
Banishing dust from the ancient library...
Clearing bones from the ogre’s lair...
Washing blood from the arena’s stones...
Purifying relics in the temple’s font...
Dousing lanterns in the watchtower...
Scrubbing grime from the dungeon walls...
Unsnaring traps from the spider’s keep...
Scattering ashes in the pyromancer’s den...
Mopping ichor from the ritual stones...
Dispersing fog in the banshee’s vale...
Wiping runes from the summoning circle...
Hauling rubble from the crumbled keep...
Collecting teeth from the troll’s dining hall...
Bottling whispers from the echo chamber...
Dismissing summoned entities from the ritual circle...
Extinguishing flames in the phoenix's nest...
Dissolving constructs in the acid pools...
Unraveling enchantments from the archmage's staff...
Banishing spirits back to the ethereal plane...
Erasing runes from the forbidden grimoire...
Dismantling golems in the animation chamber...
Cleansing corruption from the blighted grove...
Releasing bound elementals from their prisons...
Melting down failed experiments in the alchemist's forge...
Severing ties to the otherworldly dimensions...
Emptying vials in the poison master's cabinet...
