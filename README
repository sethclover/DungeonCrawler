### Assignment 1.05 README

For this assignment, I implemented an ncurses-based user interface
to control the player (@) with unbuffered input, replacing the
random movement from last week. Players move using keys like 7/y
(up-left), 8/k (up), etc., as specified, with > and < handling stair
navigation. Stairs generate new, non-persistent dungeons with new
monsters (7-20, settable via --nummon), and the PC spawns on the
stairs they just used, however, going immediately back will still
generate a random dungeon. Monsters retain their random personalities
and roam, killing the PC on contact. The game ends with 'Q', PC death,
or death of all monsters in the dungeon. The 'm' key displays a
scrollable monster list with relative positions, using up/down arrows
and ESC to return. The top line shows messages, while the bottom two
show status, and the dungeon spans lines 1-21.
