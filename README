### Assignment 1.03 README

For this assignment, I formed a custom implementation of a
Fibonacci heap from scratch, which was utilized for Dijkstra's
Algorithm to determine the distances to the player character for
both tunneling and non tunneling monsters, which are soon to be
implemented. The distance calculations are compatible with the
existing switches for hardness and save/load. Now, the main
function will build the dungeon, through generation or loading,
then print the mapping for tunneling and then non tunneling
distances to output.
