The dungeon generation first creates a solid border around the edge
of the perimeter. Then it creates and inserts between 6 and 8 rooms, 
which are type-defined structs containing the X and Y coordinates
of the top left corner, along with the length (X) and width (Y). The
rooms are between 4x3 and 12x12 in size. Next, it builds the
corridors by iterating through the array of stored rooms and creating
a pathway from the center point of the room to next random room in the
array by randomly selecting a direction to build it. It then places
upward and downward stairs in two different rooms that are never
directed connected, unless a corridor happens to run in bewteen them.
Finally, the dungeon is printed to stdout.
