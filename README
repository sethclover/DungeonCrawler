This project implements dungeon save and load functionality.
The dungeon is stored in a hidden directory "~/.rlg327/dungeon"
using a structured binary format. The program supports three
main operations: generating a new dungeon, saving a dungeon to
disk, and loading a previously saved dungeon. The --save switch
saves the dungeon before exiting, while the --load switch loads
and displays a saved dungeon. The dungeon file format includes
metadata such as a semantic marker, file version, and dungeon
size, along with the playerâ€™s position, dungeon layout, room
locations, and staircases. All data is stored in big-endian
format for consistency. The main function will check for each
of the switches and call the appropriate functions for generating,
saving, or loading the dungeon.
