### Assignment 1.04 README

For this assignment, I implemented monsters that have randomly
generated personalities that determine how they roam the dungeon.
The amount of monsters is random (7-20, arbitrarily), but the new
--nummon switch can set the number of monsters. If the monsters 
cannot be correctly fitted in the dungeon, it exits with a print
statement to stderr. The player also wanders the dungeon in a 
random direction every turn. When a character comes in contact
with another character, they die. The game ends when the PC kills 
all the monsters or when the PC is killed. After each turn, or when
the PC moves, it prints the dungeon and displays the locations of
every character
